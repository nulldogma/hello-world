print('A farmer goes down to the mines, looking for good ores for good tools. 
Using a worn old ladder, she decends down a few levels, well armed and well supplied. 
She was well and good, happy with her loot. 
Too late she realizes she forgot the time, all those supplies and no watch, she falls asleep. 
Wakes up in the morning safe and sound, with only one loot... a rescue bill')
